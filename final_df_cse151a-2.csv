Also that they had used ""my"" pasta for another order. He did NOT offer anything for the inconvenience and would NOT cancel my order after I made multiple requests for him to do so.

I decided to stay in the bar/lounge area after dinner where yet again the servers were wonderful, friendly, had personality, and smiled (unlike the hostess).
