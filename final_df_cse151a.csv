On this Thanksgiving Day all four in our party ordered the above but received pressed turkey, cold and uncooked yams served in little cut up squares, uncooked veggies.  It was terrible and we sent it back and ordered the fresh cut ham but it was canned ham and the sides were the same as above.  They would not allow us to order from the regular menu and the charge for this terrible dinner was $24.95 each.  The apple pie tasted okay. They have lost mine and my entire family's business.  I know these had to be different owners than the ones in the past.  The staff was all Asian, either Chinese or Japanese so perhaps they just do not know how to run an American restaurant.  Of course I love both Chinese and Japanese food but not when I expect American food in an American restaurant on an American Thanksgiving Day.  Thank you for allowing me to express my opinion and disappointment in this traditional meal that my family and I have enjoyed for years there in the past.",American Restaurant,True,1.0,"{'neg': 0.098, 'neu': 0.799, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.0266}","['enjoyed', 'fresh', 'party', 'cut', 'terrible', 'fresh', 'cut', 'allow', 'terrible', 'okay.', 'lost', 'love', 'Thank', 'disappointment', 'enjoyed']","['price', 'charge']",1,0

The location itself was nice for me personally, but already in the entrance area it became clear that it didn't seem to be the cleanest shop. I immediately noticed the crowds of employees who were smoking in front of the entrance door and didn't even look at us. I'll just say that our service for the evening was TOP. The selection of dishes from the buffet was manageable and also presented in really unsightly plastic bowls for 90 cents at Aldi. The coleslaw was definitely ready-made salad like most of the buffet. I had squid rings, fit. These were so hard they defy description. We also had the Rodizio. The first two courses of meat were fine. But what happened next, I can only agree with the previous speakers. In my opinion the cheapest and worst meat you can get for money. Greasy, chewy, partly dry and the smell alone made me try it, but I left everything behind. An incredible waste of meat and, I can't describe it any other way. DISGUSTING ! One of the waitresses, who didn't really look hygienic, kept bringing the meat and helping herself from the bowls at the buffet by hand! Definitely never again! What I noticed was that the store was full. There seem to be people who like it.

We felt like we had suddenly become invisible. My wife left the table for a bit and I gathered the serving dishes and utensils together and piled everything up on the table and stood up. Finally the manager walked over and asked if we were looking for our server. Needless to say I wasn't exactly happy by this time.
